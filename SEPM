Aim: To understand the Version Control System/Source Code Management, install Git and
create GitHub Account.
Lab Outcomes: CSL603.2- Demonstrate the different Version Control tools like GIT.
Objective: To understand basic Concept of Git.
Theory: Version Control System:
â€¢ Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing
changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams
manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated,
version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially
useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase
successful deployments. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the
code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock
and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption
to all team members.
